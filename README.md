# How we will grade the work on the projects

* Each student needs to earn 1000 points to get their "full grade" for the project component of their final grade.
* Points are awarded by TAs or the instructor, NOT by the mentors.  MENTORS DO NOT GRADE.
* HOWEVER: the mentors do "peer code review", and "coaching" and "estimating" to help organize the information that is presented to TAs and instructors for grading.

# How you can earn the 1000 points

* By completing issues (tasks, stories, pull requests) that are:
   * listed on the repo for your project
