# How we will grade the work on the projects

* Each student needs to earn 1000 points to get their "full grade" for the project component of their final grade.
* Points are awarded by TAs or the instructor, NOT by the mentors.  MENTORS DO NOT GRADE.
* HOWEVER: the mentors do "peer code review", and "coaching" and "estimating" to help organize the information that is presented to TAs and instructors for grading.

# How you can earn the 1000 points

* By completing issues (tasks, stories, pull requests) that are:
   * listed on the repo for your project
   
   
# Those story links:

# What is a Kanban board?

* Simply put: it is a visual/physical representation of work in progress. 
* The work *Kanban* comes from the Japanese language; the concept originated in work done in Japan on improving efficiency of work processes.
* The idea is to:
   * Know how much work you have at each stage in the pipeline from "TO-DO" to "WORK-IN-PROGRESS" to "DONE"
   * Use the visual representation to see how work is flowing (or not)
   * Do what you can to keep work flowing through the system
   * Minimize "WORK-IN-PROGRESS"; this is the central idea of so-called "Lean Business" (Lean Software, Lean Manufacturing, etc.)
   
# What kinds of "issues" will we put on the Kanban board?

* Anything that helps us move forward with the projects:
   * Adding features
   * Improving the UI/UX
   * Fixing bugs
   * Planning
   * "Skunk-works" projects
   * Adding testing

Note:
  * that in some "pure" forms of Agile, not all of those things would be considered "issues".  
  * Also note: "pure Agile" is contrary to the spirit of Agile.  
  * Agile values helping people getting stuff done over slavish devotion to processes or tools.
